# Facebook Automation Tool

This project aims to automate various Facebook interactions, including searching for posts and commenting on them.

## Project Goals

The main goals of this project are to develop:

-   **Automation Script:** A Python-based script using Selenium to handle Facebook login, post searching, and automated commenting with human-like delays and error handling.
-   **Backend:** A FastAPI or Flask application to expose API endpoints (`/api/search`, `/api/comment`) that trigger the automation scripts, including request validation and JSON response formatting.
-   **Frontend:** A React application (using `create-react-app` or Vite) with interfaces for search queries and commenting, connecting to the backend APIs.
-   **Security & Optimization:** Implementation of measures to encrypt sensitive data, handle captchas securely, and use delays to mimic human interaction.
-   **Documentation & Testing:** Clear documentation for all modules, along with unit tests, automation script tests, and end-to-end testing.

*(Optional Goal: Dockerize the project and deploy it to a cloud platform like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.)*
