# Automation Script Setup

This directory contains the Python scripts for automating Facebook interactions.

## Environment Setup

To run the automation scripts, you'll need to set up a Python environment and install the required dependencies.

1.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    Open your terminal in the `automation_script` directory and run:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    Activate the virtual environment:
    -   On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    -   On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    With the virtual environment activated, install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Now you are ready to develop and run the automation scripts.
